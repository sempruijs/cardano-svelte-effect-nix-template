# Cardano Svelte Effect Nix Template

Don’t waste time setting up your development environment.  
Start building your Cardano dApp right away.

You can visit [the website](https://sempruijs.github.io/cardano-svelte-effect-nix-template/) to see the working template in action.

### Motivation

I came across [Cor's Svelte Effect Nix Template](https://github.com/cor/svelte-effect-nix-template), which helped me get started with Svelte.  
However, when I wanted to start building dApps with MeshJS, I ran into a lot of issues setting up a working environment.

After spending too much time fixing bugs I didn’t want to deal with, I decided to create a template to help other Cardano developers get started faster.

## What's in the template?

- **Svelte** – Frontend framework  
- **MeshJS** – Easy interaction with Cardano wallets  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling  
- **TypeScript + Effect** – Robust and type-safe programming  
- **Nix Flakes** – Reproducible dev environment and build system  
- **GitHub Actions** – Deploys the Nix build as a static site via GitHub Pages

## Getting Started

### With Nix (recommended)

The best way to use this template is with Nix flakes.

1. Enter the development shell:

   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   nix run .#dev
   ```

3. Build the app as a static site:

   ```bash
   nix build
   ```

4. Preview the build locally:

   ```bash
   nix run
   ```

### Without Nix

> ⚠️ **Note:** Do not delete `flake.nix` or `flake.lock` — they are required for deploying to GitHub Pages.

While using Nix is highly recommended for a robust setup, you can still use this template with just `npm`:

1. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   cd site
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Build the static website:

   ```bash
   cd site
   npm run build
   ```
